ENCHANTED FOREST

Original game idea by Fabrizio Caruso

This is an memory game.

You need to find 10 hearts in the forest at night.
You have the chance to see the positions of the hearts and the deadly skulls during the day.

At night you will only discover the area around you as you move in the forest.

You have a limited amount of energy, which decreases as you move.
For each heart reached you restore part of your energy.
If you 
- either finish the energy or 
- reach the top or bottom limits or 
- touch a skull, 
you die immediately.

If you find 10 hearts, you go to the next forest (with more trees).
