GEMS

Original game idea by Fabrizio Caruso

This is an action game.

Four type of gems are spawned randomly on the screen.

You can only score points if you touch 3 or more gems of the same type (and color).
The number of points increases significantly if the sequence is longer than 3.

You need to avoid two enemies that will force you to move all the time and will lose destroy any gem they encounter.



CONTROLS:
- Use I J K L to move
