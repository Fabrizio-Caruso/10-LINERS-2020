SPACE JOURNEY
for the unexpanded Commodore Vic 20 (it will NOT work on other configurations)

Original game idea by Fabrizio Caruso

This is a action game.

You are on a space journey though the asteroid belt. 
You have to avoid the ever-increasing asteroids or destroy them with your missiles.

You have a limited number of missiles. You can only carry a maximum of 9. 
You start with 5 missles and 3 lives.

If you are hit by an asteroid, you lose a life.

You can collect 3 types of items:
- [common] extra missile
- [rare] space bomb: it destroys all asteroids on the screen
- [very rare] extra life


The number of asteroids increase as you progress into the asteroid belt.
The game never ends.

CONTROLS:
- Use J L to move 
- SPACE to fire a missile
