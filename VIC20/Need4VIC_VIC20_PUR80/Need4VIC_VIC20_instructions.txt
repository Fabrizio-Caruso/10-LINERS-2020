NEED for VIC
for the unexpanded Commodore Vic 20 (it will NOT work on other configurations)

Original game idea by Fabrizio Caruso

This is a action game.

You need to overtake all the cars, the guard-rails and the trees.

If you touch a car or a guardrail, your car's damage increase.

If the damage reaches level 9, your game ends.

With time, your damage will decrease very slowly.

If you bump into a tree, you get max damage and your game ends instantly.

The road becomes narrower as you advance in the game.

The game never ends.

CONTROLS:
- Use J L to move
