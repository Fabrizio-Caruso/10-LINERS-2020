VIRUS
for the MSX 1 series in MSX BASIC 1.0

Original game by Fabrizio Caruso

This is an action game.

You are an antibody fighting against the virus-infected cells (red cells).
Virus-infected cells will block your movements. If you cannot reach good cells (blue cells), you die.
The only way to fight against the virus is to digest good cells, in that for each digested cells, you generate 5 or more good cells at random positions.
In order to temporarily increase the power to reproduce good cells you should reach some energizing cells (yellow-green flashing cells)
The virus grows around cluster of infected cells.
If you touch the top or bottom walls, you die.
The left and right borders wrap around.

The game never ends. The virus becomes increasingly more aggressive.
