This game is an original text role game by Fabrizio Caruso.
The game concept was inspired by the Italian text-based role-playing game "Conan" (aka "Avventura"):

- The setting
You are Conan, an adventurer who goes on quests to recover treasures and slaughter enemies.


- The Inn
The Inn is your base from which you can choose one of 3 quests or go to the merchant to buy some of its items.

- Conan's abilities

-- Energy
Conan's life level is given by the his energy.
When below 1, he is dead.

-- Power and Speed
Conan (as well as the enemies) has 2 main abilities:
1. power (used in attacks): it increase by fighting and by completing quests
2. speed (used when fleeing enemies): it increases by succeeding escapes and completing quests


-- Boots level
A boot level higher than zero, means that your next escape will be successful and with no energy loss.

-- Armor level
A higher armor level means that you lose fewer points in fights and failed escapes.


- The Merchant
The merchant sells 3 types of items:
1. Potion (+10 energy, consumed immediately)
2. Boots (+10 boot level, consumed when escaping from enemy encounters): Each upgrade provides safety in the next 10 escape attempts
3. Armor: (+1 armor level, never consumed): It provides a 20% damage reduction factor when you fight and a much higher reduction when you fail an escape

Remark: There is a constant supply of potions when your return from a quest. Boots and armor upgrades are never replenished.

- Enemies
1. Trolls (fast and weak)
2. Orcs (slow and strong)
3. Elves (very fast and moderately strong)
4. Werewolves (very strong and moderately fast)


- The Quests
1. Forest (only trolls and orcs here)
2. Cave (only trolls, orcs and elves here)
3. Dark Woods (trolls, orcs, elves and werewolves here)


- Enemies fights
When you fight, you may lose an amount of energy that depends:
- the enemy strength
- the number of enemies (quadratically)
- a random factor
- your armor
A fight ends with dead enemies. You may also die if your energy is below 1.

- Escapes
When you try an escape you may succeed or fail.
When you fail you get a penalty that depends on:
- the enemy speed
- the number of enemies (quadratically)
- a random factor
The lost points are significantly fewer than in a fight with the same enemies.
After you fail you can decide to try an escape or attack.
If you have a positive boots level, your escape will always succeed with no lost points but your boot level decreases by 1.


- Game progression
The number of enemies will slowly increases in all 3 quests

- Strategy
Simple initial strategy is to attack weak, fast enemies and escape from strong, slow enemies.
As your abilities increase, you will be able to fight against stronger enemies and run away from faster enemies.

- Game's end
The game has no ending other than your death!
You will get an increasing number of enemies in your fights and your abilities will increase as long as you survive fights and escapes.
The goal of the game is get to the highest possible score (which is given by the sum of all successful fights and escapes).
